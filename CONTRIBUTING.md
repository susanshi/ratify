# Contributing to Ratify

Welcome! We are very happy to accept community contributions to Ratify, whether those are [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), [Plugins](#plugins), [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) or [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)! Please note that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as well as the terms of the [CLA](#cla).

## Getting Started

* If you don't already have it, you will need [go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.16+ installed locally to build the project.
* You can work on Ratify using any platform using any editor, but you may find it quickest to get started using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
* Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
* Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/ratify.git`.
* Build the Ratify CLI with `go build -o ./bin/ratify ./cmd/ratify` or if on Mac/Linux/WSL `make build-cli`.

## Pull Requests

If you'd like to start contributing to Ratify, you can search for issues tagged as "good first issue" [here](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/labels/good%20first%20issue).

We use the `dev` branch as the our default branch. PRs passing the basic set of validation can be merged to the `dev` branch, we then run the full suite of validation including cloud specific tests on `dev` before changes can be merged into `main`. All ratify release are cut from the `main` branch. A sample PR process is outlined below:
1. Fork this repo and create your dev branch from default `dev` branch.
2. Create a PR against default branch
3. Maintainer approval and e2e test validation is required for completing the PR.
4. On PR complete, the `push` event will trigger an automated PR targeting the `main` branch where we run a full suite validation including cloud specific tests.
6. Manual merge is required to complete the PR. (**Please keep individual commits to maintain commit history**)

If the PR contains a regression that could not pass the full validation, please revert the change to unblock others:
1. Create a new dev branch based off `dev`.
2. Open a revert PR against `dev`.
3. Follow the same process to get this PR gets merged into `dev`.
4. Work on the fix and follow the above PR process.

## Developing

### Components

The Ratify project is composed of the following main components:

* **Ratify CLI** (`cmd/ratify`): the `ratify` CLI executable.
* **Config** (`config`): an example configuration file for `ratify`.
* **Deploy** (`deploy`): the deployment files for using ratify in a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Ratify Internals** (`pkg`): the internal modules containing the majority of the Ratify code.
* **Plugins** (`plugins`): the referrer store and verifier plugins for the Ratify Framework.

### Running the tests

* You can use the following command to run the full Ratify test suite:
  * `go test -v ./cmd/ratify` on Windows
  * `make test` on Mac/Linux/WSL

### Running the Ratify CLI

* Once built run Ratify from the bin directory `./bin/ratify` for a list of the available commands.
* For any command the `--help` argument can be passed for more information and a list of possible arguments.

### Debugging Ratify with VS Code

Ratify can run through cli command or run as a http server. Create a [launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) file in the .vscode directory, then hit F5 to debug. Note the first debug session may take a few minutes to load, subsequent session will be much faster.

Sample json for cli:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
      "name": "Debug Ratify cli ",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/ratify",
      "args": ["verify", "-s", "ratify.azurecr.io/testimage@sha256:9515b691095051d68b4409a30c4819c98bd6f4355d5993a7487687cdc6d47cc3"]
    }]
}
```

Sample launch json for http server:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
      "name": "Debug Ratify ",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/ratify",
      "args": ["serve", "--http", ":6001", "-c", "/home/azureuser/.ratify/config.json"]
    }]
}
```

Sample curl request to invoke Ratify endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6001/ratify/gatekeeper/v1/verify -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"apiVersion":"externaldata.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1","kind":"ProviderRequest","request":{"keys":["localhost:5000/net-monitor:v1"]}}'
```

#### Debug external plugins

External plugin processes must be attached in a separate debug session. Certain environment variables and `stdin` must be configured

Sample launch json for debugging a plugin:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [{
    "name": "Debug SBOM Plugin",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "auto",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/plugins/verifier/sbom",
    "env": {
      "RATIFY_EXPERIMENTAL_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS": "1",
      "RATIFY_LOG_LEVEL": "debug",
      "RATIFY_VERIFIER_COMMAND": "VERIFY",
      "RATIFY_VERIFIER_SUBJECT": "wabbitnetworks.azurecr.io/test/image:sbom",
      "RATIFY_VERIFIER_VERSION": "1.0.0",
    },
    "console": "integratedTerminal"
  }]
}
```
Once session has started, paste the `json` formatted input config into the integrate terminal prompt.
Note: You can extract the exact JSON for the image/config you are testing with Ratify by starting a regular Ratify debug session. Inspect the `stdinData` parameter of the `ExecutePlugin` function [here](pkg/common/plugin/exec.go)

Sample JSON stdin 
```json
{
  "config": {
    "artifactTypes":"application/spdx+json",
    "name":"sbom",
    "disallowedLicenses":["AGPL"],
    "disallowedPackages":[{"name":"log4j-core","versionInfo":"2.13.0"}]
  },
  "storeConfig": {
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "pluginBinDirs":null,
    "store": {
      "name":"oras",
      "useHttp":true
    }
  },
  "referenceDesc": {
    "mediaType":"application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
    "digest":"sha256:...",
    "size":558,
    "artifactType":"application/spdx+json"
  }
}
```

Press `Ctrl+D` to send EOF character to terminate the stdin input. (Note: you may have to press `Ctrl+D` twice)

### Test local changes in the k8s cluster scenario

There are some changes that should be validated in a cluster scenario.
Follow the steps below to build and deploy a Ratify image with your private changes:

#### build an image with your local changes

```bash
export REGISTRY=yourregistry
docker buildx create --use

docker buildx build -f httpserver/Dockerfile --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg build_sbom=true --build-arg build_licensechecker=true --build-arg build_schemavalidator=true --build-arg build_vulnerabilityreport=true -t ${REGISTRY}/ratify-project/ratify:yourtag .
docker build --progress=plain --build-arg KUBE_VERSION="1.29.2" --build-arg TARGETOS="linux" --build-arg TARGETARCH="amd64" -f crd.Dockerfile -t ${REGISTRY}/localbuildcrd:yourtag ./charts/ratify/crds
```

#### [Authenticate](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#usage) with your registry,  and push the newly built image

```bash
docker push ${REGISTRY}/ratify-project/ratify:yourtag
docker push ${REGISTRY}/localbuildcrd:yourtag
```

#### Update dev.helmfile.yaml
Replace Ratify `chart` and `version` with local values:
```yaml
...
chart: chart/ratify
version: <INSERT VERSION> # ATTENTION: Needs to match latest in Chart.yaml
...
```
Replace `repository`, `crdRepository`, and `tag` with previously built images:
```yaml
- name: image.repository 
  value: <YOUR RATIFY IMAGE REPOSITORY NAME>
- name: image.crdRepository
  value: <YOUR RATIFY CRD IMAGE REPOSITORY NAME>
- name: image.tag
  value: <YOUR IMAGES TAG NAME>
```

### Deploy using Dev Helmfile

Development charts + images are published weekly and latest versions are tagged with rolling tags referenced in dev helmfile.

Deploy to cluster:
```bash
helmfile sync -f git::https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify.git@dev.helmfile.yaml
```

### Deploy from local helm chart

#### Update [values.yaml](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/blob/main/charts/ratify/values.yaml) to pull from your registry, when reusing image tag, setting pull policy to "Always" ensures we are pull the new changes

```json
image:
  repository: yourregistry/ratify-project/ratify
  tag: yourtag
  pullPolicy: Always
```

Deploy using one of the following deployments.
Note: Ratify is compatible with Gatekeeper >= 3.12.0. Server auth is required to be enabled.

**Option 1**
Client auth disabled and server auth enabled using self signed certificate

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify --atomic
```

**Option 2**
Client auth disabled and server auth enabled using your own certificate

Deploy using a certificate

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify \
    --set provider.tls.cabundle="$(cat certs/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n\r')" \
    --set provider.tls.key="$(cat certs/tls.key)" \
    --set provider.tls.crt="$(cat certs/tls.crt)" \
    --atomic
```

**Option 3**
Client / Server auth enabled (mTLS)  

>Note: Ratify and Gatekeeper must be installed in the same namespace which allows Ratify access to Gatekeepers CA certificate. The Ratify certificate must have a CN and subjectAltName name which matches the namespace of Gatekeeper and Ratify. For example, if installed to the namespace 'gatekeeper-system', the CN and subjectAltName should be 'ratify.gatekeeper-system'*

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system \
    --set provider.tls.cabundle="$(cat certs/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n\r')" \
    --set provider.tls.key="$(cat certs/tls.key)" \
    --set provider.tls.crt="$(cat certs/tls.crt)" \
    --atomic
```

### Test/debug local changes in k8s cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes

Bridge to Kubernetes is an [open source project](https://github.com/Azure/Bridge-To-Kubernetes) to enable local tunneling of a kubernetes service to a user's development environment. It operates by forwarding all requests going to a specified service to the configured local instance running. This guide will focus on VSCode with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Prerequisites:
- Install [Kubernetes Toosl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) plugin for VSCode
- Install [Bridge to Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mindaro.mindaro) plugin for VSCode
- Connect to K8s cluster
- Namespace context set to Ratify's installation namespace (default is `gatekeeper-system`)

Gatekeeper requires TLS for external data provider interactions. As such ratify must run with TLS cert and key configured on server startup. The current helm chart will automatically generate the cabundle, cert, and key if none are manually specified. For ease of use in starting the local ratify server on our development environment, we should pre generate the TLS ca bundle, cert, and key and instead provide them during helm installation. 

1. Generate TLS cabundle, cert, and key. By default this will place the tls/cert folder in the $WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
    ```
    make generate-certs
    ```
1. Rename files server.crt and server.key to tls.crt and tls.key
1. Updated helm install command
    ```
    helm install ratify \
      ./charts/ratify --atomic \
      --namespace gatekeeper-system \
      --set logger.level=debug \
      --set-file notationCerts[0]=./test/testdata/notation.crt \
      --set-file provider.tls.crt=./tls/certs/tls.crt \
      --set-file provider.tls.key=./tls/certs/tls.key \
      --set-file provider.tls.cabundle="$(cat ./tls/certs/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n\r')" \
      --set-file provider.tls.caCert=./tls/certs/ca.crt \
      --set-file provider.tls.caKey=./tls/certs/ca.key
    ```
Update the `KubernetesLocalProcessConfig.yaml` with updated directory/file paths:
- In the file, set the `<INSERT WORKLOAD IDENTITY TOKEN LOCAL PATH>` to an absolute directory accessible on local environment. This is the directory where Bridge to K8s will download the Azure Workload Identity JWT token. 
- In the file, set the `<INSERT CLIENT CA CERT LOCAL PATH>` to an absolute directory accessible on local environment. This is the directory where Bridge to K8s will download the `client-ca-cert` volume (Gatekeeper's `ca.crt`). 

Configure Bridge to Kubernetes (Comprehensive guide [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/bridge/bridge-to-kubernetes-vs-code))
1. Open the `Command Palette` in VSCode `CTRL-SHIFT-P`
2. Select `Bridge to Kubernetes: Configure`
3. Select `Ratify` from the list as the service to redirect to
4. Set port to be 6001
5. Select `Serve w/ CRD manager and TLS enabled` as the launch config
6. Select 'No' for request isolation

This should automatically append a new Bridge to Kubernetes configuration to the launch.json file and add a new tasks.json file. 

NOTE: If you are using a remote development environment, set the `useKubernetesServiceEnvironmentVariables` field to `true` in the tasks.json file. 

Start the debug session with the generated Bridge to Kubernetes launch config selected. This will start up the local Ratify server and forward all requests from the Ratify service to the local instance. The http server logs in the debug console will show new requests being processed locally.

## Feature Areas
### Plugins

If you'd like to contribute to the collection of plugins:

#### Referrer Store

* A referrer store should implement the `ReferrerStore` interface (`pkg/referrerstore/api.go`).
* This should provide a mechanism to list referrers, and retrieve manifests and blob content.
* A sample referrer store is provided at `plugins/reffererstore/sample/sample.go`.

#### Verifier

* A verifier should implement the `ReferenceVerifier` interface (`pkg/verifier/api.go`).
* This should provide a mechanism to perform verification against blobs and manifests from a referrer store.
* A sample verifier is provided at `plugins/verifier/sample/sample.go`.

## Feature Suggestions

* Please first search [Open Ratify Issues](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/issues) before opening an issue to check whether your feature has already been suggested. If it has, feel free to add your own comments to the existing issue.
* Ensure you have included a "What?" - what your feature entails, being as specific as possible, and giving mocked-up syntax examples where possible.
* Ensure you have included a "Why?" - what the benefit of including this feature will be.

## Bug Reports

* Please first search [Open Ratify Issues](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/issues) before opening an issue, to see if it has already been reported.
* Try to be as specific as possible, including the version of the Ratify CLI used to reproduce the issue, and any example arguments needed to reproduce it.
